# Reviewing Processing
See: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#computer-apps
- Creating a 3x3 "Choose Your Own Adventure" (previous Home Screen Assignment and Tic-tak-toe Introduction), review this assignment and Processing-JAVA
  - 2D Images & Composite Shapes
  - Text: flat and algorithm for developing size calculator (algorithm ends itself)
    - https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Text-Prototyping
  - Images
- Buttons
- Sound and Music

# Next Steps ...

#### Weather App, API, and Population of Variables (leads to Constructor in OPP)
- Prototype Weather App, then Design GUI with rect() and paper
  - See GitHub: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Weather-App
- Lessons about API and Population of Variables
- Finish Weather App: reviews lessons from above

#### Text to Canvas with Algorithm to set size
- **Purpse:** when the geometry changes, the font size automatically changes
- Mercer's Kithchen: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Text-Prototyping
- See https://processing.org/reference/textWidth_.html
- Basic Algorithm: WHILE `textWidth(String)` > `rectWidth` textSize--
- CAUTION: font may need % reduction due to WHITESPACE design (returns disappearance in canvas if *too big*)
- Note: introduce WHILE as iteration without knowing how many interations needed
- Reminder: FOR requires known interations

#### Tic Tac Toe Algorithms
- TBA
- See GitHub: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
