# Android App Development

Hyperlinks: *insert link here*

See Old Repository: https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Intermediate-Computer-Science

Extending the GUI Focus of Introductory CS to include Simple Game Design and App Design, improving user experience
- APIs for Sensor and Variable Population (Weather App)
- Tic Tac Toe Computer Player Mode

### Other details: this *Science Option* does **not** include a *Diploma Exam*
- "The Grade" is only between the student and Mr. Mercer
- Learning, Evaluation, and Assessment

### Industry-level: Hosing code, versions, final version and executables in GitHub
- Exporting executables in processing are important in grading
- Jar Files, dependencies processing has added that might be different on my machine, will be included
- Exemplar executable program files one step from deploying to Android, <a href="">Click Here when Available</a>

# How we learn

Coding the Hard Way: typing out every line, sometimes using copy and paste
- Caution: Processing-JAVA will break if copy and paste is used too much (copy into Notepad to delete hidden formatting characters or retype the entire doc)
- See https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Common-Syntax-Error-and-Solution
- Mr. Mercer will demonstrate his method for typing code

Evaluation: bugs and talking about code provides Mr. Mercer anecdotal evidence of your learning

Assessment: multiple types
- submitting coded apps so Mr. Mercer can experience the user experience and read some code
- submitting narrated videos (max 60 seconds) of code highlighting coding structures Mr. Mercer is asking for while explaining what they do (arithmetic, GUI & Design, loops, decisions, behaviors, interactions, other groups of code, etc.)
- Coding smaller solutions to a subproblem, then combining solutions for the larger problem demonstrates increasing sophistications of computational thinking

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

---
# Review Progression
- Case Study for Choose Your Own Adventure
- Review Processing-Java
- Website Promotion of Choose Your Own Adventure OR a Website for this as a more developed *book* (using JavaScript Lessons as code to develop book-metaphor)

# Reviewing Processing
See: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#computer-apps
- 2D Images & Composite Shapes
- Text: flat and algorithm for developing size calculator (algorithm ends itself)
- Images
- Buttons
- Sound and Music

### Review Assignment: Practicing Narratives for the interaction of apps
- Using the Introductory "3x3 Assignment", create a Case Study for ...
- Creating a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
  1. Create a story from images (no more than 9, able to reuse images if necessary)
    - at least 2 characters: the reader and the one in the story
    - For Example: "Walking Down my Street"
    - For Example: with each choice we get to know the character in the story more until the end
  3. must create simple text
    - 1-image per box (9-total images to tell a story)
    - 1-sentence description of each image
    - 1-choice with at least two pathways (use clickable buttons)
  4. organize images and text into flowchart (similar to flowcharting a case study or "how a program behaves")
  5. download background music and sound effects (i.e. YouTube Audio Library)
  6. starting with primitive date, brainstorm ways data could be organized differently (use experience from Play Lists in Music Player App Project)
- Reorganize the 3x3 Case Study into different single images
- Review Booleans to create different "pages", a metaphor for more complicated programs

# Next Steps ...

#### Text to Canvas with Algorithm to set size
- **Purpse:** when the geometry changes, the font size automatically changes
- Mercer's Kithchen: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Text-Prototyping
- See https://processing.org/reference/textWidth_.html
- Basic Algorithm: WHILE `textWidth(String)` > `rectWidth` textSize--
- CAUTION: font may need % reduction due to WHITESPACE design (returns disappearance in canvas if *too big*)
- Note: introduce WHILE as iteration without knowing how many interations needed
- Reminder: FOR requires known interations

#### Weather App, API, and Population of Variables (leads to Constructor in OPP)
- Prototype Weather App, then Design GUI with rect() and paper
  - See GitHub: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Weather-App
- Lessons about API and Population of Variables
- Finish Weather App: reviews lessons from above

#### Tic Tac Toe Algorithms
- TBA
- See GitHub: https://github.com/Intermediate-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

Reminder about Creating RELEASES for Due Dates
- Releases are created from your most recent "stable version" or due date using the MAIN Branch
- Reminder: Create a TAG like BETA (press the ADD Button)
- If you have access to a non-school computer, you can also EXPORT your program so it runs on any computer like it is yours. This helps with grading
  - File / Export: exports Processing and Java files (called jar files) so the Processing and Java Installations and configuration are not required, automatically runs as if on your computer (after downloaded)
  - If you EXPORT,  Reminder: Drag and Drop your files into BINARY
- Must share GitHub URL for your RELEASE to find your final version
- Alternatively, create a new Repository or Folder and Upload the exported file there.
